# Board Pickup — Multi-Issue Delegation (Steps 6b, 6c)

Delegation details for Steps 6b and 6c of `hatch3r-board-pickup`. Referenced from the core command file.

## 6b. Epics -- Sub-Agent Delegation (One Implementer Per Sub-Issue)

For epics with sub-issues, delegate each sub-issue to a dedicated implementer sub-agent. The parent orchestrator (this agent) coordinates dependency order, parallelism, and git operations.

### 6b.1. Parse Sub-Issues Into Dependency Levels

1. Fetch the epic's `## Implementation Order` section.
2. Group sub-issues by dependency level:
   - **Level 1:** Sub-issues with no unsatisfied blockers (can start immediately).
   - **Level N:** Sub-issues whose blockers are all in levels < N.
3. Within each level, identify parallelizable sub-issues (no mutual dependencies).

### 6b.2. Prepare Shared Context

Before spawning implementer sub-agents, delegate context gathering to the **hatch3r-researcher agent protocol**.

1. Read the epic body (goal, scope, constraints).
2. Spawn a researcher sub-agent following the **hatch3r-researcher agent protocol** with:
   - **Research brief:** The epic title, goal, scope, constraints, and area labels.
   - **Modes:** `codebase-impact`, `risk-assessment`
   - **Depth:** `standard` for most epics. Use `quick` if the epic has fewer than 3 sub-issues or is well-specified with linked specs. Use `deep` if the epic spans multiple modules or introduces new patterns.
   - **Project context:** Pre-loaded documentation references from area labels.
3. Await the researcher result. Include the structured output as shared context in all implementer sub-agent prompts in Step 6b.3.

### 6b.2b. Per-Sub-Issue Complexity Scoring and Tier-Adjusted Research

After the shared epic-level research, score each sub-issue individually and run additional research for sub-issues that warrant it.

1. **Score each sub-issue** per the `hatch3r-deep-context` rule to determine the analysis tier (Light / Standard / Deep).

2. **For Tier 2+ sub-issues**, spawn per-sub-issue **hatch3r-researcher** sub-agents via the Task tool (`subagent_type: "generalPurpose"`). Launch as many concurrently as the platform supports.

   Each per-sub-issue researcher prompt must include:
   - The sub-issue title, body, acceptance criteria, and area labels.
   - Research modes by issue type (same as Step 6a.1).
   - **Tier-adjusted modes** (per `hatch3r-deep-context`):
     - Tier 2: add `requirements-elicitation` + `similar-implementation` at `quick` depth
     - Tier 3: add `requirements-elicitation` + `similar-implementation` at `deep` depth, plus `codebase-impact` at `deep` depth with transitive tracing
   - Depth by risk level, with complexity tier overriding upward.
   - The shared epic-level researcher output from Step 6b.2 (to avoid redundant analysis).

3. **Await all per-sub-issue researchers.** Collect structured outputs. Each researcher's output feeds exclusively into its corresponding implementer in Step 6b.3.

4. **For Tier 2 sub-issues:** Present the `requirements-elicitation` questions to the user inline and await answers before proceeding.

5. **For Tier 3 sub-issues:** Present a full Pre-Implementation Summary per the `hatch3r-deep-context` rule. Do NOT proceed to 6b.3 until all unresolved questions are answered.

6. **Tier 1 sub-issues** skip this step — they use only the shared epic-level context from Step 6b.2.

### 6b.3. Execute Level-by-Level With Parallel Sub-Agents

For each dependency level, starting at Level 1:

1. **Spawn one implementer sub-agent per sub-issue in the current level.** Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "generalPurpose"`. Launch as many sub-agents concurrently as the platform supports.

2. **Each sub-agent prompt must include:**
   - The sub-issue number, title, full body, and acceptance criteria.
   - The issue type (bug/feature/refactor/QA) and corresponding hatch3r skill name.
   - Parent epic context (title, goal, related sub-issues at the same level).
   - The shared researcher output from Step 6b.2 (codebase impact and risk assessment as shared context).
   - The per-sub-issue researcher output from Step 6b.2b (if this sub-issue scored Tier 2+).
   - **Reference conventions** from `similar-implementation` output (Tier 2/3) — triggers the implementer's Convention Lock step.
   - **Resolved requirements** from `requirements-elicitation` answers (Tier 2/3) — explicit decisions on ambiguities.
   - **Blast radius data** from enhanced `codebase-impact` (Tier 3) — transitive dependency trace and API consumer map.
   - Documentation references relevant to this sub-issue.
   - Instruction to follow the hatch3r-implementer agent protocol.
   - All `scope: always` rule directives from `.agents/rules/` — subagents do not inherit rules automatically.
   - Relevant learnings from `.agents/learnings/` (from Step 6.pre).
   - Instruction to use GitHub MCP for issue reads, and follow the project's tooling hierarchy for external knowledge augmentation.
   - Explicit instruction: do NOT create branches, commits, or PRs.
   - Confidence expression requirement: rate every recommendation and finding as high/medium/low confidence per the quality charter (`agents/shared/quality-charter.md`). High = verified against current code. Medium = pattern-based, not fully verified. Low = best judgment, recommend human review.

3. **Await all sub-agents in the current level.** Collect their structured results (files changed, tests written, issues encountered).

4. **Review sub-agent results:**
   - If any sub-agent reports BLOCKED or PARTIAL, **ASK** the user how to proceed (skip, fix manually, retry).
   - If sub-agents modified overlapping files, review for conflicts and resolve before proceeding.

5. **Advance to the next dependency level.** Repeat steps 1-4 until all levels are complete.

### 6b.4. Post-Delegation Verification

After all sub-agents complete:

1. Run a combined quality check across all changes.
2. Resolve any cross-sub-issue integration issues.
3. Verify no file conflicts between parallel sub-agent outputs.

---

## 6c. Multi-Issue Batch -- Parallel Subagent Delegation (One Implementer Per Issue)

For batches of multiple standalone issues (selected via batch mode in Step 1d or by referencing multiple issue numbers), delegate each issue to a dedicated implementer sub-agent. The parent orchestrator (this agent) coordinates dependency levels, parallelism, collision avoidance, and git operations.

### 6c.1. Group Issues Into Dependency Levels

1. Use the updated cross-issue dependency graph (from Step 2e, adjusted by Step 3.4).
2. Group issues by dependency level:
   - **Level 1:** Issues with no dependencies on other issues in the batch (can start immediately). Most standalone issues will be Level 1.
   - **Level N:** Issues that depend on other issues in levels < N.
3. Within each level, all issues are parallelizable (no mutual dependencies — conflicts were moved to separate levels in Step 3).

### 6c.2. Context Gathering (Parallel Researchers)

**Skip this step only** if ALL issues in the batch are trivial single-line edits (typos, comment fixes, single-value config changes) that score Tier 1 per `hatch3r-deep-context`. The `risk:low` and `priority:p3` labels alone are not sufficient to skip research — always score complexity first.

Unlike epics (which share a single researcher), standalone issues in a batch are unrelated and each need individual context gathering.

1. **Spawn one hatch3r-researcher sub-agent per issue** via the Task tool (`subagent_type: "generalPurpose"`). Launch as many concurrently as the platform supports.

2. **Each researcher prompt must include:**
   - The issue title, body, acceptance criteria, and area labels.
   - Research modes by issue type (same as Step 6a.1).
   - Tier-adjusted modes per `hatch3r-deep-context` (same as Step 6a.1).
   - Depth by risk level (`quick` / `standard` / `deep`), with complexity tier overriding upward.
   - Project context and documentation references.

3. **Await all researchers.** Collect structured outputs. Each researcher's output feeds exclusively into its corresponding implementer in Step 6c.3. For Tier 2/3 issues, present elicitation questions to the user and await answers before proceeding.

### 6c.3. Execute Level-by-Level With Parallel Implementers

For each dependency level, starting at Level 1:

1. **Spawn one hatch3r-implementer sub-agent per issue in the current level.** Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "generalPurpose"`. Launch as many sub-agents concurrently as the platform supports.

2. **Each sub-agent prompt must include:**
   - The issue number, title, full body, and acceptance criteria.
   - The issue type (bug/feature/refactor/QA) and corresponding hatch3r skill name.
   - Batch context: sibling issues in the batch at the same level (for awareness, not implementation).
   - The researcher output from Step 6c.2 for this specific issue (if that step was not skipped).
   - **Reference conventions** from `similar-implementation` output (Tier 2/3) — triggers the implementer's Convention Lock step.
   - **Resolved requirements** from `requirements-elicitation` answers (Tier 2/3).
   - **Blast radius data** from enhanced `codebase-impact` (Tier 3).
   - Documentation references relevant to this issue.
   - Instruction to follow the **hatch3r-implementer agent protocol**.
   - All `scope: always` rule directives from `.agents/rules/` — subagents do not inherit rules automatically.
   - Relevant learnings from `.agents/learnings/` (from Step 6.pre).
   - Explicit instruction: do NOT create branches, commits, or PRs.
   - Confidence expression requirement: rate every recommendation and finding as high/medium/low confidence per the quality charter (`agents/shared/quality-charter.md`). High = verified against current code. Medium = pattern-based, not fully verified. Low = best judgment, recommend human review.

3. **Await all sub-agents in the current level.** Collect their structured results (files changed, tests written, issues encountered).

4. **Review sub-agent results:**
   - If any sub-agent reports BLOCKED or PARTIAL, **ASK** the user how to proceed (skip, fix manually, retry).
   - If sub-agents modified overlapping files, review for conflicts and resolve before proceeding.

5. **Advance to the next dependency level.** Repeat steps 1-4 until all levels are complete.

### 6c.4. Post-Batch Verification

After all implementer sub-agents complete across all levels:

1. Run a combined quality check across all changes from all issues.
2. **File conflict resolution:** When parallel sub-agents modify the same file, apply this resolution protocol:
   - **Disjoint regions:** Accept both changes (non-overlapping edits to different functions/sections).
   - **Overlapping regions:** If changes touch the same lines or function, merge manually using the sub-agent that modified the larger scope as the base, then apply the smaller-scope change on top. Run tests after merge.
   - **Semantic conflicts:** If two sub-agents make contradictory changes to the same interface, type, or contract, halt and surface both changes to the user with the conflict description. Do not auto-resolve semantic conflicts.
   - **Prevention:** Step 3 (collision detection) should move file-overlapping issues to sequential dependency levels. Conflicts at this stage indicate a missed overlap in Step 3.4.
3. Verify no regressions between parallel sub-agent outputs.

### 6c.5. Post-Implementation Quality Pipeline

After all implementations complete, run the two-stage quality pipeline across the entire batch. Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "generalPurpose"`.

**Stage 1 — Review Loop (sequential):**

1. Spawn **`hatch3r-reviewer`** — code review of ALL changes across the batch. Include the full diff and acceptance criteria for each issue. The reviewer sub-agent output MUST include a top-level `confidence: high | medium | low` field (not just per-finding) so the gate in step 4 can evaluate it deterministically.
2. If the reviewer reports Critical or Warning findings, spawn **`hatch3r-fixer`** with the reviewer output to apply fixes. When fixes touch shared or public interfaces, also include:
   - **Blast radius data** from Step 6c.2 (if available) — so the fixer knows which consumers and contracts must be preserved.
   - **Reference conventions** from Step 6c.2 (if available) — so the fixer maintains established patterns when applying fixes.
3. Re-spawn **`hatch3r-reviewer`** to verify fixes.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for a maximum of **3 iterations** until the confidence-aware gate passes: **0 Critical + 0 Warning AND reviewer confidence != low**. If reviewer confidence is low but there are no Critical/Warning findings, trigger a second reviewer pass before exiting the loop; do not exit until the second pass returns non-low confidence OR the user explicitly accepts the low-confidence PASS.
   After each reviewer iteration, assess the reviewer's findings confidence: if the reviewer rates any finding as low-confidence, flag it separately in the ASK prompt so the user can prioritize human review of uncertain findings.
5. If still not clean after 3 iterations, **ASK** the user how to proceed.

**Stage 2 — Final Quality (parallel, after review loop is clean):**

Launch as many independent sub-agents in parallel as the platform supports.

**Always spawn (mandatory for every code change):**
- **hatch3r-test-writer** — tests for all code changes across the batch.
- **hatch3r-security-auditor** — security review of all code changes across the batch.

**Always evaluate (spawn when applicable):**
- **hatch3r-docs-writer** — spawn when any changes affect public APIs, architectural patterns, or user-facing behavior.

**Conditional specialists (spawn when triggered by any issue in the batch):**
- **hatch3r-lint-fixer** — spawn when lint errors are present after implementation.
- **hatch3r-a11y-auditor** — spawn when any issue has `area:ui` or `area:a11y` labels.
- **hatch3r-perf-profiler** — spawn when any issue has `area:performance` label.

Await all specialist sub-agents. Apply their feedback before proceeding to Step 7.
