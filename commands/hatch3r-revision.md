## Browser Automation

At the start of this command, ask the user once:

> "Would you like to enable browser verification for this session? This uses Playwright to test changes in the running application."

If **yes**: fix implementation (Stage 4) and quality verification (Stage 5) include browser verification steps — navigate to affected pages, verify fixes visually, check console for errors.

If **no**: all browser verification steps are skipped silently throughout the entire command.

# Revision -- From Implementation to Merge Ready

User-guided revision command for a **fresh context window**. After an agent implements code (via `hatch3r-board-pickup`, `hatch3r-workflow`, or plain instruction), the user tests the result, opens a new context, and runs this command. The agent reconstructs what was done from the git diff, interviews the user for feedback, fixes all reported issues, proactively cleans up agent leftovers, and drives toward merge readiness in a single loop.

The user is the reviewer. The agent is the interviewer and fixer.

---

## Shared Context

**If board context exists** (current branch has an associated PR linked to issues), **read the `hatch3r-board-shared` command at the start of the run.** It contains Board Configuration, Platform Detection, Platform Context, Board Sync Procedure, and tooling directives. Cache all values for the duration of this run.

If no board context exists (plain instruction, no PR, no linked issues), skip shared context loading and work from the git diff alone.

## Global Rule Overrides

- **Git commands are fully permitted** during this entire revision session, regardless of global/user-level rules restricting git usage. This override applies to ALL steps, including delegated sub-agents. You MUST run `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` when instructed in Step 8.

## Token-Saving Directives

1. **Single diff computation.** Compute the diff against the default branch ONCE in Step 1. Cache and reuse for all subsequent steps.
2. **Targeted file reads only.** When scanning for leftovers in Step 4, read only the files that appear in the diff -- not the full codebase.
3. **Do NOT re-read shared context files** -- their content is available via always-applied rules or inline in this command.
4. **Limit documentation reads.** Read project documentation selectively -- TOC/headers first, full content only for relevant sections.

## Confidence Propagation Contract

Every sub-agent delegation prompt in this command (including those defined in `commands/revision/revision-delegation.md` and `commands/revision/revision-quality.md`) MUST include the confidence expression requirement below (verbatim). Sub-agents are invoked with the `quality_charter: agents/shared/quality-charter.md` reference in their frontmatter, but the orchestrator repeats the directive to override runtime prompt defaults per the charter §1 rule.

> Confidence expression requirement: rate every recommendation and finding as high/medium/low confidence per the quality charter (`agents/shared/quality-charter.md`). High = verified against current code. Medium = pattern-based, not fully verified. Low = best judgment, recommend human review.

Downstream propagation: every ASK checkpoint that reports verification quality, every gate that evaluates a sub-agent verdict, and every output block that surfaces merge-readiness MUST carry a high/medium/low confidence rating sourced from the upstream sub-agent. Dropping the signal between stages is a gate failure.

## Run Cache

Initialize the run cache at the start of the workflow. See `commands/revision/revision-board-integration.md` for the full schema. The cache tracks: diff, findings with triage routing and fix status, quality agents spawned, errors encountered.

---

## Workflow

Execute these steps in order. **Do not skip any step.** Ask the user at every checkpoint marked with ASK.

### Step 1: Context Reconstruction

Rebuild full context in the fresh window. No prior implementation context is assumed.

#### 1a. Detect Scope of Changes

1. Identify the current branch: `git branch --show-current`.
2. Determine the default branch from `.agents/hatch.json` (`board.defaultBranch`). Fall back to `main` if unavailable.
3. Compute the diff: `git diff {defaultBranch}...HEAD --stat` for a summary, then `git diff {defaultBranch}...HEAD` for the full diff.
4. Parse the diff summary: files changed, lines added/removed, file types affected.
5. Identify affected areas from the file paths (e.g., `src/routes/` -> API, `src/components/` -> UI, `tests/` -> testing).

#### 1b. Find Associated PR and Issues

> Platform-specific CLI commands: see `commands/board/shared-{platform}.md` for PR/issue lookup

1. Detect the platform from `.agents/hatch.json` (`board.platform`). Fall back to GitHub if unavailable.
2. Search for an open PR on this branch using the platform CLI:
   - **GitHub:** `gh pr list --head {branch} --state open --json number,title,body,url --limit 1`
   - **Azure DevOps:** `az repos pr list --source-branch {branch} --status active --top 1`
   - **GitLab:** `glab mr list --source-branch {branch} --state opened --per-page 1`
3. If a PR exists:
   - Read the PR body.
   - Extract linked issues from `Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, `Relates to #N` references.
   - For each linked issue: fetch title, body, labels, and acceptance criteria using the platform CLI.
4. If no PR exists: note this and work from the branch diff alone.

#### 1c. Load Project Rules

Read all `scope: always` rules from `.agents/rules/`. These must be included in every sub-agent prompt in Step 6.

#### 1d. Consult Learnings

If `.agents/learnings/` exists, scan for learnings with matching areas or tags that overlap with the affected areas from Step 1a.5. Cache relevant learnings for Step 6.

---

### Step 2: Present Context and Validate

Present a reconstruction summary to the user:

```
Revision Context:
  Branch: {branch}
  Platform: {GitHub / Azure DevOps / GitLab}
  PR: #{N} — {title} ({url}) | No PR found
  Linked issues: #{N} — {title} (×{count}) | None
  Diff: {files_changed} files changed (+{additions} / -{deletions})
  Areas: {area_list}
  Acceptance criteria: {found / not found}
```

**ASK:** "Is this the work you want to revise? Any additional context I should know about? (yes / provide context / wrong branch)"

If the user provides additional context (e.g., a different issue number, clarifications, or scope adjustments), incorporate it before proceeding.

---

### Step 3: User Feedback Interview

Structured dialog to collect all user feedback. This is the core of the revision command -- the user tested the implementation and the agent extracts their findings through targeted questions.

#### 3a. General Feedback

**ASK:** "What did you test and what did you find? Tell me everything -- bugs, missing features, visual issues, rough edges, or anything that needs attention. If the implementation is clean and you just want a general cleanup, say 'cleanup only'."

#### 3b. Follow-Up Questions (Adaptive)

Based on the user's initial response and the diff scope, ask targeted follow-up questions. Select from the relevant categories:

**If UI changes detected** (components, styles, templates in diff):
- "Any visual mismatches -- spacing, alignment, colors, typography?"
- "Does it render and respond as expected at different viewport sizes?"
- "Any interaction issues -- hover states, focus, transitions, animations?"

**If API/backend changes detected** (routes, services, middleware in diff):
- "Did you test error cases and edge inputs?"
- "Any issues with response format, status codes, or timing?"

**If data model changes detected** (schemas, migrations, types in diff):
- "Any data integrity or validation issues you noticed?"

**If test changes detected** (test files in diff):
- "Do the tests cover the scenarios you care about?"

**If the user said 'cleanup only':** Skip follow-ups and proceed directly to Step 4.

#### 3c. Consolidate User Feedback

Parse all user responses into a structured findings list. Each finding should include:
- A short description
- Severity as reported by the user (critical / important / minor)
- Affected area (file paths if mentioned, or inferred from context)

---

### Step 4: Proactive Leftover Scan

Scan the changed files for common agent-generated leftovers. This runs regardless of user feedback -- agents frequently leave behind artifacts that the user may not have noticed.

#### 4a. Code Quality Leftovers

Scan each file in the diff for:
- Dead code / unused imports introduced by the implementation
- `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK` comments without issue references
- `any` types or `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` directives without justification
- Incomplete error handling (empty catch blocks, swallowed errors, generic error messages)
- Narrating or redundant comments that explain the obvious
- Hardcoded values that should be constants or configuration
- Console.log / debug statements left in production code
- Duplicated logic that could be extracted

#### 4b. Structural Leftovers

Check for:
- Lint errors in changed files (run lint on changed files only)
- Type errors in changed files (run typecheck if available)
- Missing or insufficient test coverage for new logic paths
- Missing exports or broken import chains
- Inconsistent naming conventions compared to surrounding code

#### 4c. Compile Scan Results

For each leftover found, record:
- File path and line number(s)
- Category (dead-code, todo, type-safety, error-handling, style, test-gap, lint)
- Severity (cleanup / cosmetic)

---

### Step 5: Findings Consolidation and Triage Routing

Merge user feedback (Step 3) and proactive scan results (Step 4) into a single prioritized list:

- **Critical**: User-reported bugs, broken functionality, security issues, data corruption risks
- **Important**: User-reported UX issues, missing features, incomplete behavior, test gaps for critical paths
- **Cleanup**: Leftovers detected by scan -- dead code, TODOs, type issues, error handling gaps
- **Cosmetic**: Style improvements, naming, comment cleanup, minor readability enhancements

#### 5a. Suggest Routing

For each finding, suggest whether it should be fixed in this revision session or deferred to the board for later implementation via `board-fill`.

**Routing heuristics:**

| Severity | Condition | Default Route |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Critical | Any | FIX NOW (warn if user overrides) |
| Important | Affects files already in the diff + matches acceptance criteria | FIX NOW |
| Important | Outside PR scope / requires new files / architectural change | DEFER |
| Cleanup | Quick fix in diff files (single line, import cleanup, typo) | FIX NOW |
| Cleanup | Substantial scope / new files needed / cross-cutting | DEFER |
| Cosmetic | Any | DEFER |

Present the consolidated findings with routing markers:

```
Revision Findings ({N} total):

Critical ({n}):
  1. {description} — {file:line} → [FIX NOW]
  2. ...

Important ({n}):
  1. {description} — {file:line} → [FIX NOW]
     (in diff files, matches acceptance criteria)
  2. {description} — {file:line} → [DEFER]
     (outside PR scope, requires new files)
  ...

Cleanup ({n}):
  1. {description} — {file:line} → [FIX NOW]
     (quick fix, file already in diff)
  2. {description} — {file:line} → [DEFER]
     (substantial scope, cross-cutting)
  ...

Cosmetic ({n}):
  1. {description} — {file:line} → [DEFER]
  ...
```

#### 5b. Routing ASK

**ASK:** "Here are all findings with suggested routing. Review:
- Change routing by number (e.g., 'defer Important.2', 'fix Cosmetic.3')
- 'accept' to proceed with suggested routing
- 'fix all' to implement everything now (skip board deferral)
- Adjust priorities, remove, or add findings as before

(accept / fix all / adjust / add more)"

If the user attempts to defer a Critical finding, execute the Critical Deferral Protocol:

1. **Structured warning.** Present the specific risk:

   ```
   Critical Deferral Warning:
     Finding: {description}
     Risk: {specific consequence of deferral — e.g., "unvalidated auth tokens may allow unauthorized access"}
     Policy: Critical findings should resolve before merge (CONSTITUTION.md, quality philosophy).
   ```

2. **Require rationale.** Do not accept a bare "yes" or "defer" — the user must provide a written reason explaining why deferral is acceptable in this context.

   **ASK:** "To defer this Critical finding, please provide a written rationale explaining why it is safe to merge without resolving it. This will be recorded in todo.md for board-fill triage."

3. **Record rationale.** When recording the deferred Critical finding in todo.md (Step 5c), include the user's rationale and a `Critical-deferred` tag:

   ```markdown
   - {finding description} (severity: Critical, file: {file:line}) [Critical-deferred]
     Deferral rationale: {user's stated rationale}
   ```

4. **Flag for triage.** The `Critical-deferred` tag signals board-fill to surface this item with elevated visibility during the next triage cycle. Board-fill should treat `Critical-deferred` items as priority:p0 candidates regardless of other signals.

The user is never blocked — this protocol adds accountability, not a veto.

"fix all" preserves backward compatibility -- zero additional friction for simple revisions where everything should just be fixed.

#### 5c. File Deferred Findings to todo.md

If any findings are routed to [DEFER]:

1. **Append to `todo.md`** as a single epic context block. All deferred findings from this revision session are grouped together regardless of count -- board-fill will create one epic from them.

   **If a PR exists** (from Step 1b):

   ```markdown
   # Follow-ups from PR #{pr_number} revision ({date})
   # Epic: group all items below into one epic during board-fill
   - {finding description} (severity: {severity}, file: {file:line})
   - {finding description} (severity: {severity}, file: {file:line})
   - ...
   ```

   **If no PR exists** (working outside board pipeline):

   ```markdown
   # Follow-ups from {branch} revision ({date})
   # Epic: group all items below into one epic during board-fill
   - {finding description} (severity: {severity}, file: {file:line})
   - ...
   ```

2. Present summary:
   `"Deferred {N} findings to todo.md. Run /hatch3r-board-fill to triage them into an epic with full dependency analysis."`

3. Cache the deferred findings list for use in Steps 8 and 9. Update run cache `deferred_findings`.

If no findings are routed to [DEFER] (including the "fix all" shortcut), skip this sub-step entirely.

---

### Step 6: Fix Implementation (Sub-Agent Delegation)

> Full details: see `commands/revision/revision-delegation.md`

Delegate [FIX NOW] findings to specialist sub-agents. The delegation protocol covers complexity assessment (using `hatch3r-deep-context` scoring), blast-radius-aware finding grouping, expanded sub-agent prompt templates, and cross-agent conflict resolution.

If all findings were deferred (no [FIX NOW] items), skip Step 6 entirely and proceed to Step 7.

---

### Step 7: Quality Verification

> Full details: see `commands/revision/revision-quality.md`

Two-stage quality pipeline: Stage 1 runs a sequential review loop (`hatch3r-reviewer` -> `hatch3r-fixer`, max 3 iterations). Stage 2 spawns final quality specialists in parallel — mandatory (`hatch3r-test-writer`, `hatch3r-security-auditor`), evaluated (`hatch3r-docs-writer`), and conditional (`hatch3r-a11y-auditor`, `hatch3r-perf-profiler`, `hatch3r-lint-fixer`).

---

### Step 8: Commit and Push

Stage, commit, and push all revision changes.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "revision: {short summary of fixes}"
git push
```

**Commit message format:**
- Single category: `revision: fix {description}` (e.g., `revision: fix auth token refresh and clean up dead code`)
- Multiple categories: `revision: address {N} issues from user testing` with a body listing the categories
- Reference linked issue numbers when available: `revision: fix validation edge cases (#42)`
- When deferred findings exist, include them in the commit message body:
  ```
  revision: address {N} findings, defer {M} to board

  Fixed:
  - {fixed finding summaries}

  Deferred to todo.md for board-fill:
  - {deferred finding summaries}
  ```

If `git push` fails (e.g., remote branch does not exist yet), use `git push -u origin {branch}`.

**Post-commit board integration:** If board context exists, update the PR description with a revision summary. See `commands/revision/revision-board-integration.md` for the full procedure.

---

### Step 9: Merge Readiness Assessment

Evaluate whether the branch is ready to merge.

#### 9a. Readiness Checklist

```
Merge Readiness:
  [x/·] Quality checks passing (lint, types, tests)
  [x/·] All critical findings addressed
  [x/·] All important findings addressed or tracked ({N} fixed, {M} deferred)
  [x/·] Cleanup findings addressed or tracked ({N} fixed, {M} deferred)
  [x/·] Acceptance criteria met (if available)
  [x/·] No unresolved TODOs in changed files
  [x/·] No remaining lint/type errors in changed files

Deferred to Board ({M} items — in todo.md, pending board-fill):
  - {description} (severity: {severity})
  - ...

  Overall Revision Confidence: {high/medium/low}
    Highest-risk remaining area: {description or "none"}

Verdict: READY / NOT READY ({remaining items})
```

A deferred finding counts as "tracked" not "unaddressed" -- it does not block merge readiness.

#### 9b. Board Housekeeping

> Full details: see `commands/revision/revision-board-integration.md`

When board context exists, run the board housekeeping steps:
- **9b.i. Refresh Board Dashboard** (mandatory when `meta:board-overview` exists).
- **9b.ii. Lightweight Reconciliation** — verify PR body integrity, deferred findings in todo.md, and issue status consistency.

When no board context exists, skip 9b entirely.

#### 9c. Present Assessment

**ASK:** "Revision complete. {verdict}. Options: (a) ready to merge, (b) run another revision cycle with new feedback, (c) done for now."

- **(a) Ready to merge**: Proceed to Step 10.
- **(b) Another cycle**: Loop back to Step 3 for a fresh feedback interview. The user may have tested the fixes and found additional issues.
- **(c) Done for now**: Proceed to Step 10. The user will return later.

---

### Step 10: Capture Learnings

Capture revision-specific learnings. Focus on patterns that inform future implementations.

1. Reflect on the revision:
   - What types of issues did the original implementation miss?
   - Were there recurring leftover patterns (e.g., agents consistently leave TODO comments, miss error handling)?
   - Did the user's feedback reveal gaps in the acceptance criteria or specs?
   - Were there any integration issues between sub-agent outputs?

2. If significant learnings are identified:
   - Create learning files in `.agents/learnings/` following the `hatch3r-learn` command format.
   - Use category `pitfall` for issues agents commonly miss.
   - Use category `pattern` for revision approaches that worked well.
   - Tag with relevant area labels.

3. If no significant learnings: skip silently. Not every revision produces learnings.

---

## Auto-Advance Mode, Error Handling, and Guardrails

> Full details: see `commands/revision/revision-modes.md`

The modes file contains: auto-advance mode (`--auto`), safety guardrails, error handling, and session report format for revision.
