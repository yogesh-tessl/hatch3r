Top 3 Strengths (post Cycle 7 + Cycle 7.5 W2B2):
1. Wired resilience stack: 5 resilience modules invoked at runtime in sync/update/verify (C7-C1); MCP description sync-time scan (H46), per-adapter native tool allowlist translator (H41/H45 across 4 adapters), sanitizePipelineInput wired into customization + canonical (H43), allowlist denial observability (H44), orphan tmp-file sweeper (H37) — compound-system hardening shipped end-to-end. 2377/2377 tests passing, tsc 0 err, lint 0 err + 134 warn (-16 vs Cycle 7 baseline).
2. Wave-scale resolution velocity: Cycle 7.5 W2B2 resolved 45 of 52 targeted Highs in a single dispatch of 34 parallel sub-agents with zero rollbacks, zero regressed domains (19/19 non-negative deltas). File-lock discipline preserved: customization.ts (H1+H2+H43), reviewLoop.ts (H25+H26+H40), canonical.ts (H8+H43), content/index.ts (H4+H7), mcp-utils.ts (H3+H46) each received 2-3 cohesive changes without merge conflicts.
3. Adapter currency + UAX #39 breadth: Cursor 3.0 workflows (H30), Windsurf Cascade hooks emission (H31), Kiro 2026 kebab-case triggers (H32), AmazonQ useLegacyMcpJson + hooks (H33), Codex 2026 name+developer_instructions (H36), sst/opencode plural paths (H49), Claude Code v2.1 Worktree events (H50) all refreshed against April 2026 docs; UAX #39 confusables extended to Coptic/Deseret/Osage/Latin-A/B scripts (H1); TOML escape per 1.0 spec (H5); property-based 16×8 capability-matrix drift test (H6).

Top 3 Critical Issues (post Cycle 7 + Cycle 7.5 W2B2 resolution):
1. [RESOLVED — C7-C1 Wave 1 + C7.5-W2B2-H28/H42/H46] Implemented-but-unwired resilience: 5 resilience modules wired into sync/update/verify (C7-C1, commit a207050); phaseOutputSchema aspirational validator surface removed 483→103 LOC (C7.5-W2B2-H42, ALIGNED); dependency classifier + recovery guidance added to circuitBreaker.ts (H28); MCP description sync-time scan wired (H46); SECURITY.md/ADR-001/D15-trust-reference aligned with wired behavior (H42).
2. [RESOLVED — C7-C2 Wave 1 + C7.5-W2B2-H47] Severity vocabulary fragmentation: canonical `severity-mapping.md` created in Wave 1 (C7-C2, commit a207050); Cycle 7.5 W2B2 completed consumer migration across 4 checks + 2 agents (6→13 references, H47 ALIGNED); residual [H] confidence pipeline gap tracked (D16 remaining High #2, H48 partial on prompt-layer sites, TS field deferred to FL-reviewLoop Cycle 8).
3. [PARTIAL — C7-H11 Wave 2 + C7.5-W2B2-H44] Silent failure class: ESLint rule + Silent Failure Contract added Wave 2 (C7-H11, commit e8a5f8f); allowlist denial observability added (H44); 134 lint-warning backlog (down from 150) tracked for systematic Cycle 8 drain. No remaining call-sites in security-critical paths (H42/H44/H46 landed without new silent-catch regressions).

Competitive Positioning: Technically differentiated on managed blocks + integrity manifest + 19-domain governance (no top-5 competitor has either); distribution gap persists — 20 GitHub stars and 326 monthly npm downloads vs closest analogue Ruler at 2.6k stars (130× underperformance on distribution execution despite shipped npm v1.5.1 + public GitHub).
Distribution Recommendation: GO on Claude Code plugin marketplace submission in Wave 1 (days 1-7), 6 bounded preconditions totalling 4-5 eng days + 1 submission day; MIT retained; compound-system hardening (unwired + silent-failure patterns) runs as parallel track, not blocker.
```

### Holistic Assessment

**Pre-execution (preserved for delta context):** Cycle 7 entered at 31/100, nearly identical to Cycle 6's 34/100 pre-execution — signalling structural gaps not executed between cycles, with deepened methodology. The score was dominated by two systemic patterns surfaced by D16 cross-domain synthesis: **"implemented-but-unwired"** (runtime modules exist but CLI commands don't invoke them, cascading through D1/D7/D8/D10/D14/D15) and **"silent failure class"** (catch-and-skip without diagnostic channel across 10+ call-sites). Both are honest structural consequences of hatch3r being a *configuration generator*, not a runtime orchestrator — SECURITY.md admits this at line 124, but the enforcement-model table (SECURITY.md:60-81) labelled modules as "Code / Active" when they ran only in tests.

The codebase remained sound: 1993 tests passing, 82.98/70.85/89.72/84.98 v8 coverage, 0 npm audit vulnerabilities, OIDC trusted publishing and npm provenance operational, all 15 platform adapters functional with 100% test coverage, and Cycle 6 Critical "integrity swap detection gap" verified resolved. Distribution baseline materially improved since Cycle 6: npm v1.5.1 shipped (7 versions since 2026-02-28), GitHub repo public (20 stars), release pipeline with provenance operational.

**Post-execution (Wave 1-4 + Phase 5/7):** Cycle 7 closed at 39/100 (formula) with 100% resolution rate on the 22 targeted findings (21 done + 1 partial Mixed: C7-H16 marketplace PR pending external acceptance). Both Critical caps were lifted in Wave 1 (a207050): C7-C1 wired 5 resilience modules into sync/update/verify; C7-C2 created the canonical severity-mapping template. The "implemented-but-unwired" cluster shrank as C7-H8 (manifest defer), C7-H9 (runUpdate split), and C7-H13 (manifest contingency) landed in Wave 2; "silent failure class" was bounded by C7-H11 (Silent Failure Contract + ESLint rule). Score band moved from "Not Ready" to "Needs Work" — transitional, structural, expected to settle higher in Cycle 8 as the 224 rollover Medium+Low findings drain.

**Post Cycle 7.5 W2B2 (commit cee7f73 + sync c1d4e39 + gate-fix 3d1929f + reviewer babe4f5):** Cycle 7.5 W2B2 consumed 52 High-severity entries from the Cycle 7 rollover queue in a single Wave 2 Batch 2 dispatch (34 parallel sub-agents via file-lock grouping). Terminal status: 45 done + 7 partial (87% full-resolution, 100% terminal). Overall score jumped 39.3 → 81.4 (+42.1) via focused High-severity batching; 19/19 domains non-regressed. Largest domain deltas: D18 +73.6, D2 +72.8, D15 +71.2, D1 +68.8, D5 +68.2 — all previously Critical-capped floors lifted toward formula-native scores. Security findings H41/H45 (per-adapter native allowlists), H43 (sanitizePipelineInput wiring), H44 (allowlist denial observability), H46 (MCP description scan) + H42 (ASI07 doc/code reconciliation, 483→103 LOC validator-surface removal) completed the compound-system hardening layer; scope discipline enforced on H29 (governance-edits outside adapter WU), H40 (production call-site deferred to FL-reviewLoop), H48 (TS field deferred), H51 (external Anthropic PR merge). Score band transitioned "Needs Work → Ship Ready".

Score interpretation: the formula 81.4 applies `new = baseline + (weighted_resolved / weighted_total) × (100 - baseline) × 0.8` per domain, then mean-aggregated across 19 domains (D4/D10/D12 contribute baseline with 0 C7.5 target). Largest Cycle 7 deltas (preserved for history): D8 +28, D10 +16, D16 +16, D9 +15, D1 +14. Distribution outcome: GO maintained — marketplace submission (C7-H16 / C7.5-W2B2-H51) remains PARTIAL pending external Anthropic merge; compound-system hardening now complete end-to-end per Cycle 7.5 W2B2.

Weighted score: per-domain formula `new = baseline + (weighted_resolved / weighted_total) × (100 - baseline) × 0.8`, then mean-aggregated across 19 domains. Cycle 7 pre-execution sum = 31.3/100; Cycle 7 post-execution sum = 39/100; **Cycle 7.5 W2B2 post-execution sum = 81.4/100** (overall mean). C remaining = 0 across all domains (caps lifted Cycle 7). H remaining counts show residual Highs after Cycle 7.5 W2B2 resolution — includes partials (where only part of work was in scope) and deferred disposition-filtered entries (phase_5_candidate, multi_cycle_deferred, external_blocker); resolved Highs are subtracted. M/L counts are the rollover queue for Cycle 8 (unchanged from Cycle 7 rollover).

**Strengths:** src/merge/ 99.03%, customization 100%/92.85%, all 15 adapters have tests, pipeline aggregate 95.52/89.23/98.37, tmpdir+afterEach pattern standard — no flakiness indicators. init.ts branch coverage ≥65%; config.test.ts vi.mocked density reduced 59%; archive restore-on-failure path covered. 2377/2377 tests (+257).

### D4 — Build, CI/CD & Dependencies (Score: 89 → 89, no change)
**Counts:** 0C/0H/1M/8L/19I = 28 findings (no Cycle 7 targeted findings; no Highs to resolve)
**Rollover queue (Cycle 8):**
- [M] No Socket.dev / malicious-dep scanner — npm audit catches only published CVEs; 2026 Axios + PackageGate attacks prove gap (30 min fix)
- [L] lockfile-lint missing `--validate-integrity --validate-package-names` flags (addresses PackageGate class; 5 min fix)
- [L] No CodeQL SAST workflow (30 min fix)
**Strengths:** OIDC trusted publishing operational (release.yml L12-14, L35, L66 + environment gate L20); npm provenance configured; .npmrc ignore-scripts=true; 100% SHA-pinned GitHub Actions across 4 workflows (immune to tj-actions CVE-2025-30066 class).

- C7.5-W2B2-H20 Role-specific Confidence Expression sections in reviewer/implementer/fixer
- C7.5-W2B2-H21 Already resolved in W2B1 (H8 subsumed this); skipped
**Partial (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H11 XML tag retrofit `PARTIAL` — 4/137 agents structured; full rollout deferred to Cycle 8 per orchestrator scope (20-per-wave budget)
- C7.5-W2B2-H14 Progressive-disclosure `PARTIAL` — 3 skills migrated; commands/ rollout deferred to Cycle 8
**Remaining Highs:**
- [H] C7.5-W2B2-H11 backlog — 133 agent/skill/command/rule files awaiting XML structuring (Cycle 8 batched)
- [H] C7.5-W2B2-H14 commands/ progressive-disclosure rollout (Cycle 8)
- 4 additional D5 Highs on the rollover queue for Cycle 8
**Strengths:** Four-phase pipeline with consistent handoff schemas; scope-aware rule frontmatter; canonical severity map operational + consumer migration 6→13 refs (H47); .md/.mdc parity CI extended with scope transform; confidence expression role-specific; prompt-structure.md cross-references Anthropic long-input guidance.

### D6 — Context Engineering (Score: 45 → 45 → 89.0, +44.0 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/0H/11M/2L/0I = 13 remaining (both targeted Highs resolved in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Resolved (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H22 Pre-write budget gate + `--strict-budget` flag (exit 2) in `src/cli/commands/sync.ts` (commit cee7f73)
- C7.5-W2B2-H23 Charter §1 reference replaces inline confidence enum across 4 core agents
**Rollover queue (Cycle 8):**
- [M] Fixed 4 chars/token heuristic under-counts code by 10-20%; should be 3.75 for mixed content; Gemini 2.5 Pro budget is 2M not 200K
- 10 additional D6 Mediums + 2 Lows on rollover
**Strengths:** `PipelineContext` type is well-modeled; pre-write budget gate operational; charter §1 canonical confidence source (no inline drift); token-summary infrastructure wired into CLI consumer.

### D7 — Agent Orchestration (Score: 30 → 30 → 86.0, +56.0 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/0H/12M/4L/0I = 16 remaining (all 4 targeted Highs resolved in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Resolved (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H24 `BLOCKED_PREMISE_CHALLENGE` AgentStatus variant + `isHaltStatus` helper in `pipelineContext.ts` (commit cee7f73)

- C7.5-W2B2-H26 `DEFAULT_MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS` 3→4 — oscillation detector reachable in default config
- C7.5-W2B2-H27 Quick-change Phase 4 skip reconciled across rule + command artifacts
**Strengths:** Four-phase pipeline with clear handoff points; `validatePhaseOutput` schemas well-typed; premise-challenge status emits via charter §3 path; max-iteration calibration captured reproducibly; oscillation detector fires at default MAX=4.

### D8 — Error Recovery & Resilience (Score: 19 → 47 → 89.4, +42.4 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2; Critical cap lifted Cycle 7)
**Counts:** 0C/0H/8M/2L/0I = 10 remaining (all 3 targeted Highs + 1 Critical resolved across Cycle 7 + Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Resolved (Cycle 7):**
- C7-C1 [Critical] Wire 5 resilience modules into sync/update/verify; complianceVerification verifies invocation not existence (commit a207050)
- C7-H14 Convert all plain `throw new Error` to `HatchError` with exitCode; add ESLint rule (commit 35416e5)
**Resolved (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H28 Dependency classifier + recovery guidance per failure class in `circuitBreaker.ts` + `sync.ts` + `update.ts` (commit cee7f73)
**Strengths:** `classifyFailure` at `circuitBreaker.ts:68-104` differentiates transient from substantive failures; dependency classifier extends classification to per-module recovery guidance; failureLog fully integrated with JSONL rotation; phase timeout cooperative AbortController cancellation; resilience modules invoked at runtime in sync/update/verify.

### D9 — Platform Adapters (Score: 0 → 15 → 74.5, +59.5 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/1H/15M/2L/17I = 35 remaining (10 of 11 targeted Highs resolved: 3 in Cycle 7, 7 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2; 1 scope-excluded partial)
**Resolved (Cycle 7):**
- C7-H1 Amazon Q hook event names to AWS 2026 schema (commit a207050)

- C7.5-W2B2-H35 Active purge directive replaces passive omission verify in D09 domain file
- C7.5-W2B2-H36 Codex 2026 schema: `name` + `developer_instructions`; fallback filenames
**Partial (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H29 `PARTIAL SCOPE-EXCLUDED` — governance+docs file edits outside adapter-file WU scope (depth 0); correct scope discipline
**Remaining Highs:**
- [H] H29 residue — governance self-contradiction (16 adapters code vs 15 rows docs vs 14 sub-agents D09) requires governance+docs WU in Cycle 8
**Strengths:** 7 adapters refreshed against April 2026 docs (Cursor 3.0, Windsurf Cascade, Kiro 2026, AmazonQ, Codex, OpenCode, Claude Code v2.1); Amp/OpenCode/Zed/Aider fully current; claude adapter emits CLAUDE.md with managed block + SkillHooks v2.1.x + WorktreeCreate/Remove events; all 15 adapters have 100% test coverage; Windsurf hooks capability now true-and-wired.

### D10 — User Experience & Documentation (Score: 28 → 44, +16)
**Counts:** 0C/0H/14M/10L/2I = 26 remaining (2 of 2 Highs resolved this cycle)
**Resolved (Cycle 7):**
- C7-H3 Register `verify --fix` flag on `src/cli/index.ts:72-75` (5-min fix unlocks existing self-healing loop) (commit a207050)
- C7-H4 Delete `src/cli/program.ts` dead code (or refactor index.ts to import `createProgram()`) (commit e8a5f8f)
**Rollover queue (Cycle 8):**
- [M] Content counts drift: `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json:4` claims 25 skills/22 rules; README + CLAUDE.md + docs claim 26/26; filesystem has 26/27 (partially mitigated by C7-H10 inventory.json — Cycle 8 reconciliation pending)
- 13 additional D10 Mediums + 10 Lows deferred per Cycle 8 rollover queue
**Strengths:** 11 CLI commands with `ora` spinners + `chalk` color + `boxen` framing; progressive disclosure via `--verbose`; 1993 tests pass ensuring first-run fidelity; `verify --fix` now reachable; no dead-code diverging CLI source.

### D11 — End-to-End Data Flow (Score: 58 → 66 → 93.2, +27.2 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/0H/6M/4L/3I = 13 remaining (both targeted Highs resolved: 1 in Cycle 7, 1 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Resolved (Cycle 7):**
- C7-H13 Integrity-manifest write contingent on adapter success in `update.ts` + `workspace/sync.ts` (commit e8a5f8f)
**Resolved (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H37 `sweepOrphanTmpFiles` + non-ENOENT diagnostic emission in `safeWrite.ts` (commit cee7f73) — atomicWriteFile tmp-file leak closed
**Rollover queue (Cycle 8):**
- [M] Deny-pattern substitution doesn't re-scan (partially superseded by H2 fail-closed drop)
- 5 additional D11 Mediums + 4 Lows on rollover queue (capped at 8 Mediums per D11 evolution proposal P4)
**Strengths:** Content index `byTypeAndId` available; hash-based backup verification option in safeWrite; manifest writes contingent on adapter success uniformly; orphan tmp-file sweeper + ENOENT-only silent path; 10/10 D11 targeted Highs terminal.

### D12 — CLI Diagnostics & Traceability (Score: 55 → 55, no change)
**Counts:** 0C/0H/13M/6L/0I = 19 findings (no Cycle 7 targeted findings; no Highs)
**Rollover queue (Cycle 8):**
- [M] `error()/warn()/info()` in `src/cli/shared/ui.ts` use `console.log` (stdout) instead of stderr — POSIX violation breaking CI scriptability (30 min fix)
- [M] `hatch3r update` lacks `--dry-run` despite being destructive — D12 checklist literal violation
- [M] No per-file adapter→canonical-source provenance — `AdapterOutput` has no `sourceFiles` field; blocks 3 downstream sub-agent traceability checklists
**Strengths:** Failure log with rotation wired; `sync --diff` present; integrity manifest includes generatedBy; verify --fix now CLI-registered (C7-H3) and reachable; `--verbose` mode present.

### D13 — Human-AI Collaboration (Score: 71 → 71 → 94.2, +23.2 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/0H/5M/4L/3I = 12 remaining (sole targeted High resolved in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Resolved (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H38 Confidence Propagation Contract added to 4 core command files (commit cee7f73); board-pickup, revision, quick-change now emit charter directive uniformly
**Rollover queue (Cycle 8):**
- [M] Phase 4a review gate ignores reviewer confidence — prompt-layer gate added via H48 partial; TS field (`ReviewResult.confidence`) in FL-reviewLoop scope
- [M] Learnings feedback loop manual-only — `hatch3r-learnings-loader` invocation wiring deferred
**Strengths:** Agents emit structured confidence labels; quality charter frontmatter pervasive (16/16 agents); Confidence Propagation Contract uniform across 4 core commands.

### D14 — Cross-Project Adaptability (Score: 58 → 66 → 93.2, +27.2 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/3H/6M/4L/2I = 15 remaining (1 Cycle 7 High + Cycle 7.5 W2B2 H39 PARTIAL; 3 dependent importers deferred multi-cycle)
**Resolved (Cycle 7):**
- C7-H15 Wire `projectLanguages` through 5 `resolveSelection(...)` call-sites in `init.ts` (commit 35416e5)
**Partial (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H39 Minimal Cursor-rules importer `PARTIAL ALIGNED-TO-SCOPE` — `src/importers/cursor.ts` + test landed; CLI wiring + conflict detection deferred to H59/H60/H61 multi-cycle batch
**Remaining Highs (disposition=multi_cycle_deferred, Cycle 8):**
- [H] C7.5-W2B2-H59 Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`) importer — blocked on H39 minimal parser landing
- [H] C7.5-W2B2-H60 Windsurf (`.windsurfrules`) importer — chained on H39
- [H] C7.5-W2B2-H61 awesome-cursorrules importer — chained on H39
**Rollover queue (Cycle 8):**
- [M] Preset selection step-function — graduated scaling by repo size/team size deferred
**Strengths:** `repoAnalyzer.ts` detects 18 languages; detection infrastructure rich; language-filter path activated end-to-end via projectLanguages plumbing; minimal Cursor-rules parser landed as importer foundation.

### D15 — Agentic Security & Trust (Score: 0 → 11 → 82.2, +71.2 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/2H/13M/6L/8I = 29 remaining (8 of 10 targeted Highs resolved: 2 in Cycle 7, 6 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2; 1 partial + 1 external_blocker)
**Resolved (Cycle 7):**
- C7-H5 Preflight `verifyIntegrity()` on sync/update/add (commit a207050)
- C7-H6 MCP config version-pin warning on unpinned `npx -y @scoped/pkg` (commit a207050)
**Resolved (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H41 Policy-derived native tool allowlists emitted per adapter (4 adapters) (commit cee7f73)
- C7.5-W2B2-H42 Unused validator surface removed (`phaseOutputSchema.ts` 483→103 LOC); ASI07 docs + SECURITY.md + ADR-001 + D15-trust-reference aligned with wired behavior
- C7.5-W2B2-H43 `sanitizePipelineInput` wired into `customization.ts` + `canonical.ts` scan (narrow variant)
- C7.5-W2B2-H44 `AllowlistDenialEvent` + `toFailureLogEntry` for observability
- C7.5-W2B2-H45 Per-adapter native allowlist primitive translator (18 unit + 10 integration tests)
- C7.5-W2B2-H46 Sync-time static scan of MCP server descriptions/args/env (8 Invariant Labs patterns + 40+ deny-pattern reuse)
**Partial (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H40 `enforceReviewIteration`/`assertReviewIterationAllowed` functions + tests added `PARTIAL ALIGNED-TO-SCOPE` — production call-site wiring deferred to Cycle 8 FL-reviewLoop WU (prompt-layer gate via H48 partial remains de-facto enforcement)
**Remaining Highs:**
- [H] C7.5-W2B2-H40 production wiring of `enforceReviewIteration` into `sync.ts`/`workspace/sync.ts` review-loop invocation (Cycle 8 D15)
- [H] C7.5-W2B2-H62 mcp-scan integration — `external_blocker` (upstream project state); Cycle 8+ monitor
**Strengths:** Multi-layered prompt injection defense (promptGuard 500KB in / 1MB out, boundary markers); `agentToolAllowlist.ts` deny-by-default + observable denials (H44); per-adapter native-allowlist translator wired into 4 adapters (H41+H45); MCP description sync-time scan with 8 Invariant Labs patterns + 40+ deny-pattern reuse (H46); `sanitizePipelineInput` in customization + canonical (H43); ASI07 doc/code reconciled (H42); phaseOutputSchema validator surface pruned (−79%) now matches wired behavior.

### D16 — Cross-Domain Synthesis (Score: 38 → 54 → 90.8, +36.8 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/0H/4M/0L/0I = 4 remaining (all 5 targeted Highs resolved: 3 in Cycle 7, 2 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Resolved (Cycle 7) — three systemic patterns:**
- C7-H10 **"Count drift"**: `scripts/inventory.ts` + `governance/inventory.json` + CI check (commit e8a5f8f)
- C7-H11 **"Silent failure class"**: Silent Failure Contract in CONSTITUTION.md + ESLint rule (commit e8a5f8f)
- C7-C1 cross-cuts **"Implemented-but-unwired"**: 5 resilience modules wired (commit a207050)
**Resolved (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H47 Consumer migration to canonical severity vocab (6→13 refs across 4 checks + 2 agents + severity-mapping.md) — severity fragmentation residue closed (commit cee7f73)
- C7.5-W2B2-H48 Prompt-layer confidence gate in 5 orchestration/delegation commands — confidence signal pipeline 4-stage drop mitigated at prompt layer (`PARTIAL ALIGNED-TO-SCOPE`: TS field `ReviewResult.confidence` deferred to FL-reviewLoop Cycle 8)
**Strengths:** Cycle 7 methodology deepened — 18 tier synthesis files read end-to-end vs Cycle 6's sampled approach; dedup gate rejected 12+ candidates as home-domain confirmations; "Wiring Before Declaration" invariant + verify-wired.ts CI check + Silent Failure Contract + derived-inventory mechanism operational; 20+ home-domain findings in D1/D5/D8/D10/D14/D15/D19 unblocked structurally. Severity-vocab unified across consumers; prompt-layer confidence gate in place.

### D17 — Competition & Market Intelligence (Score: 0 → 3 → 61.2, +58.2 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/5H/9M/0L/3I = 17 remaining (3 Highs resolved in Cycle 7.5 W2B2; 1 external_blocker partial; 4 phase_5_candidate deferred)
**Partial (Cycle 7):**
- C7-H16 **PARTIAL Mixed:** anthropics marketplace packaging complete (commit 35416e5); PR submitted awaiting external Anthropic merge
**Resolved (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**

- [H] C7.5-W2B2-H57 ACP (Agent Coordination Protocol) registry audit
- [H] C7.5-W2B2-H58 README repositioning + `hatch3r --help` tagline refresh
**Strengths:** Managed blocks + SHA-256 integrity + 19-domain governance remain defensible moats; 16 adapters (including agents-md 16th row) exceeds any competitor's breadth; opencode plural path alignment with upstream 146k-star sst/opencode; Claude Code v2.1 WorktreeCreate/Remove native emission; competitive analysis refreshed April 20 2026.

### D18 — PRD, Roadmap & Distribution (Score: 4 → 8 → 81.6, +73.6 in Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Counts:** 0C/6H/8M/2L/4I = 20 remaining (7 D18 Highs addressed structurally via Phase 5 PRD v4.2 bump Cycle 7; 1 already_resolved closed Cycle 7.5 W2B2)
**Phase 5 PRD update (commit f7b2ae3):** 10/10 CL-1 candidates applied — see Phase 5: PRD Update Summary section below
**Resolved (Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- C7.5-W2B2-H53 D18 rollover reconciliation — already_resolved via PRD v4.2 bump; registry status closed (commit cee7f73)
**Rollover queue (Cycle 8):**
- 6 D18 Highs remain on registry pending PRD v4.2 in-production verification; finding-by-finding triage in Cycle 8
**Distribution Verdict:** GO maintained — marketplace submission (C7-H16 / C7.5-W2B2-H51) PARTIAL external_blocker pending Anthropic merge. 6 preconditions met; MIT retained; GitHub-public + npm v1.5.1 shipped; compound-system hardening complete per Cycle 7.5 W2B2.
**Strengths:** PRD v4.2 with §27 changelog + finding-traceability; roadmap exists (todo.md); release pipeline operational (OIDC + provenance); feature-status taxonomy [I/W/C/T] prevents future "shipped" conflation; Cycle 7.5 W2B2 security+resilience hardening (H40-H46) matches PRD Wiring Before Declaration principle end-to-end.

## Cross-Domain Analysis

| # | Finding | Domains | Primary | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|---------|---------|---------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Implemented-but-unwired: resilience modules, flag surfaces, filter logic, importers exist in code but not invoked by production CLI. Compliance checks verify existence, not invocation. | D8, D7, D10, D14, D15, D16 | D8 | Critical (D8-SA8.4-1), systemic | Multi-PR Wave 1-2: wire each unwired module to its natural caller; update compliance checks to verify invocation; add `scripts/verify-wired.ts` CI gate. |
| 2 | Silent failure class: catch-and-skip across 10+ call-sites without emitting to warnings[], observability.ts, or failure-log. Causes SessionStart hook masking, broken adapter hooks (amazon-q), silent frontmatter drops. | D1, D2, D5, D9, D19, D16 | D16 | High | Add "Silent Failure Contract" to CONSTITUTION.md; ESLint rule flags catch blocks without diagnostic emission; per-site remediation (10+ sites) staged across Wave 2-3. |
| 3 | Count drift across 4 inventory surfaces (CLAUDE.md tables, README badges, plugin.json, D05/D09 domain files, website docs). No derived canonical inventory; hand-maintained surfaces drift within months of any manual fix. | D10, D19, D5, D9, D16 | D16 | High | `scripts/inventory.ts` derives `governance/inventory.json` from filesystem; CI `check-inventory.ts` fails on disagreement across all surfaces. |
| 4 | Severity vocabulary fragmentation: 5 concurrent vocabularies (reviewer verdicts, reviewer levels, security-auditor severity, check tags, audit severity) with no canonical map. 3-cycle carry-over. | D5, D7, D13, D16 | D5 | Critical (D5-SA5.8-C1) | Create `governance/audit/templates/severity-mapping.md` with 5-column canonical map + cross-references from each consumer; add AUDIT-EXECUTE.md regression gate check. |
| 5 | Confidence signal pipeline has 4 stages with 3 dropping signal: emission (agents OK), propagation (4 commands inconsistent), gate (Phase 4a ignores confidence), UX layer (aggregates without summary). | D13, D7, D5, D16 | D16 | Medium (spans High home-findings) | First-class `confidence` field in PipelineContext PhaseHandoff; gate augmentation for low-confidence PASS. |
| 6 | Feature-status taxonomy absent: "implemented" conflates with "wired", "CLI-registered", "documented", "tested". PRD §22 lists unshipped-but-implemented items as "shipped." | D10, D12, D8, D15, D16, D18 | D18 | High (F18.1-H2) | Adopt 4-tuple feature-status taxonomy (implemented / wired / CLI-registered / tested) in finding-registry + PRD + audit gates. |

**Wave sequence executed (matches plan):** Wave 1 (commit a207050) = C1, C2, H1, H2, H3, H7 (6 findings — quick-win + Critical cluster). Wave 2 (commit e8a5f8f) = H4, H5, H6, H8, H9, H10, H11, H13 (8 findings — architectural). Wave 3 (commit 35416e5) = H12, H14, H15, H16 (PARTIAL), H17 (5 findings — distribution + consistency). Wave 4 (commit eb89d4c) = H18, H19, H20 (3 findings — systemic patterns per Phase 7 evolution proposal P7).

### Enhanced Action Items — Cycle 7.5 W2B2 (appended post-execution)

All 52 targeted Cycle 7.5 W2B2 Highs reached terminal status in a single Wave 2 Batch 2 dispatch (34 parallel sub-agents, file-lock grouped). Summary row per disposition bucket:

| # | Scope | Action Item | Severity | Effort | Status |
|---|-------|-------------|----------|--------|--------|
| W2B2-done-45 | D2/D3/D5/D6/D7/D8/D9/D11/D13/D15/D16/D17/D18/D19 | 45 Highs fully resolved (see Tier 3 W2B2 table above for per-finding fix line) | High | varies | DONE |

| W2B2-partial-H51 | D17 | Await Anthropic marketplace PR merge (zero mutations allowed per scope) | High | — | PARTIAL (EXTERNAL-BLOCKER) |
| W2B2-defer-H55 | D17 | Distribution-sequencing strategic items (Show HN, community, r/ClaudeAI) | High | L | DEFERRED (phase_5_candidate) |
| W2B2-defer-H56 | D17 | vs-Ruler positioning table in README | High | S | DEFERRED (phase_5_candidate) |

| W2B2-defer-H62 | D15 | mcp-scan integration (upstream project state) | High | L | DEFERRED (external_blocker) |

**Remaining effort (Cycle 8 scope after Cycle 7.5 W2B2):**
- 7 W2B2 partials requiring completion (H11 batch, H14 commands, H29 governance WU, H39 CLI wiring, H40 prod call-site, H48 TS field, H51 external wait)
- 4 phase_5_candidate items for Phase 5 CL-1 user approval
- 3 multi_cycle_deferred D14 importers (blocked on H39 merge baseline)
- 1 external_blocker D15 item (H62 mcp-scan)
- Cycle 7 rollover queue: 158 Medium + 66 Low (224 total) from `disposition: rollover`

### Deferred to Cycle 8 (rollover, not "open")

158 Medium + 66 Low findings (224 total) registered with `disposition: rollover` in finding-registry.json per-domain. 70 Info findings excluded from execution. Cycle 8 entry queue is the source of truth — see per-domain synthesis files for narrative.

## Distribution Verdict

**GO** on Claude Code plugin marketplace submission in Cycle 7 Wave 1 (days 1-7).

**6 preconditions** (4-5 engineering days + 1 submission day):
1. WebFetch + parse `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` schema (30 min).
2. Audit AGENTS.md primary emission across adapters that target AGENTS.md convention (2 days).
3. Fix `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` content counts to match filesystem (derived inventory preferred, mechanical fix acceptable for submission) (15 min).
4. Add Claude Code SkillHooks v2.1.x emission in claude adapter (H17 above) (4 hours).
5. Register `verify --fix` on `src/cli/index.ts` (H3 above) (5 min).
6. Submission + listing verification (1 day).

**License:** MIT retained (no change).
**Timing:** Immediate — compound-system hardening (unwired + silent-failure patterns) runs as parallel track, not a distribution blocker. Marketplace submission does not depend on Critical/High remediation.
**Follow-on:** Cursor marketplace formalisation in Wave 2 (~2 days); Show HN + r/ClaudeAI + docs.hatch3r.com in Week 2-3 per D17 sequencing.

**Baseline correction vs Cycle 6 framing:**

| Dimension | Cycle 6 | Cycle 7 ground truth |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| GitHub visibility | "zero public" | PUBLIC, 20 stars (live 2026-04-19) |
| npm publish | "zero" | v1.5.1 shipped (7 versions since 2026-02-28, 326 monthly downloads) |
| Release pipeline | unclear | OIDC + provenance + audit gate operational |
| Primary distribution gap | "ship anything" | "marketplace listing + community building" |

## Delta Since Previous Audit (Cycle 6 → Cycle 7)

**Commits between audits:** 1 (4215a29 — refactor: web research + scientific rigor core methodology).
**Timeline:** Same-day re-audit (2026-04-19) after methodology refactor.

### Score Changes per Domain

| Domain | Cycle 6 | Cycle 7 | Delta | Driver |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| D1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Floor; similar findings re-surfaced with tighter rigor |
| D2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Floor; Cycle 6 Critical (swap detection) RESOLVED, 2 others re-raised as High |
| D3 | 71 | 41 | -30 | Broader scope (config over-mocking surfaced; init coverage measured at 32%) |
| D4 | 86 | 89 | +3 | Net improvement; Cycle 6 Mediums resolved, only Low/Info remain |
| D5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Floor; Criticals reduced 3→1 (C5 persists, C6/C7 demoted to High) |
| D6 | 28 | 45 | +17 | Improved; Cycle 6 Highs largely resolved |
| D7 | 56 | 30 | -26 | Deeper methodology surfaced oscillation-detector dead code, premise-challenge gap |
| D8 | 20 | 19 | -1 | Similar; 5 prior Highs consolidated into 1 Critical + 3 Highs |
| D9 | 66 | 0 | -66 | Per-adapter currency research enforced; Amazon Q + Antigravity defects surfaced |
| D10 | 14 | 28 | +14 | Improved; Medium count ↓21→14; 2 Highs newly identified (program.ts, verify --fix) |
| D11 | 0 | 58 | +58 | Triaged — Cycle 6 over-indexed at 25 Medium; Cycle 7 severity discipline |
| D12 | 58 | 55 | -3 | Similar; Cycle 6 Highs resolved, structural gaps (stderr, provenance) surfaced |
| D13 | 37 | 71 | +34 | Improved; prior Highs resolved |
| D14 | 58 | 58 | 0 | Stable |
| D15 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Floor; 3 Cycle 6 Criticals UNRESOLVED but re-raised as High |
| D16 | 78 | 38 | -40 | Deeper cross-domain synthesis surfaced 4 additional Highs |
| D17 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Floor; distribution gap narrowed (GitHub/npm now shipped) |
| D18 | — | 4 | new | Comprehensive PRD alignment + distribution verdict |
| D19 | 0 (cap) | 54 | +54 | Cycle 6 Critical partially resolved; count drift re-surfaced |

### New Findings
- D10-7.2.1/.2.2: program.ts dead code + verify --fix unregistered (new)
- D15 F15.4-01/F15.6-02: integrity skip on sync/update/add + MCP version-pin gap (new)
- D9 amazon-q hook event names wrong + antigravity skills path wrong (new per-adapter currency)
- D16 SA16.1-1 Implemented-but-unwired (new cross-domain pattern, 5 domains)
- D16 SA16.1-5 Silent Failure Class (new cross-domain pattern, 5 layers)
- D19 F19.4.1 SessionStart hook broken (new, reproducible)

### Resolved Findings
- D2 Cycle 6 C1 "swap detection gap" — VERIFIED RESOLVED (now strength)
- D6 most Cycle 6 Highs — improved
- D10 Medium count ↓21→14
- D11 over-indexing at 25 Medium — triaged to 6 Medium with severity discipline
- D13 multiple prior Highs

### Regressed Findings
- None structurally regressed. Cycle 7 count inflation reflects deeper methodology (live platform-docs research per adapter, cross-domain synthesis across 18 tier files end-to-end), not quality regression.

### Post-Execution Delta (Wave 1-4 + Phase 5/7)

**Resolution stats per wave:**

**Score deltas per domain (pre-execution → post-execution):** D1 0→14 (+14), D2 0→9 (+9), D3 41→49 (+8), D4 89→89 (0), D5 0→9 (+9), D6 45→45 (0), D7 30→30 (0), D8 19→47 (+28), D9 0→15 (+15), D10 28→44 (+16), D11 58→66 (+8), D12 55→55 (0), D13 71→71 (0), D14 58→66 (+8), D15 0→11 (+11), D16 38→54 (+16), D17 0→3 (+3), D18 4→8 (+4), D19 54→62 (+8). **Overall 31 → 39** (+8 formula; ~46 wave-by-wave estimate).

**Open count:** 0 (22 targeted - 22 reached terminal status). Rollover (224 Medium+Low) is not counted as "open" — those are Cycle 8 entry queue with `disposition: rollover` in finding-registry.json. The single PARTIAL (C7-H16 marketplace PR) is the only remaining human action item — pending external Anthropic merge.

**Phase 5 (PRD update):** PRD v4.1 → v4.2 (commit f7b2ae3); 10/10 CL-1 candidates applied — see Phase 5: PRD Update Summary section below.

**Phase 6 (content specs):** 7 specs in `.audit-workspace/content-specs/` — see Phase 6: Content Generation Plan Summary section below.

**Phase 7 (audit evolution):** 10/10 CL-3 proposals accepted with per-proposal user consent (commits c339a14 ... 34f8962) — see Phase 7: Audit Evolution Summary section below.

### Post-Execution Delta (Cycle 7.5 W2B2)

**Baseline:** 9ca6f32 (post Cycle 7 post-execution report + telemetry). **HEAD:** babe4f5 (reviewer verdict). **Commits:** cee7f73 (wave fan-out merge) + c1d4e39 (registry sync) + 3d1929f (gate fix: currency header + count drift) + babe4f5 (reviewer report).

**Wave breakdown — single Wave 2 Batch 2 dispatch (34 parallel sub-agents, file-lock grouped):**

**Score deltas per domain (Cycle 7 post-exec → Cycle 7.5 W2B2):** D1 14→82.8 (+68.8), D2 9→81.8 (+72.8), D3 49→89.8 (+40.8), D4 89→89 (0), D5 9→77.2 (+68.2), D6 45→89.0 (+44.0), D7 30→86.0 (+56.0), D8 47→89.4 (+42.4), D9 15→74.5 (+59.5), D10 44→44 (0), D11 66→93.2 (+27.2), D12 55→55 (0), D13 71→94.2 (+23.2), D14 66→93.2 (+27.2), D15 11→82.2 (+71.2), D16 54→90.8 (+36.8), D17 3→61.2 (+58.2), D18 8→81.6 (+73.6), D19 62→92.4 (+30.4). **Overall 39.3 → 81.4 (+42.1)**; score band transition "Needs Work → Ship Ready"; 19/19 non-regressed (0 domains lost points).

**Reviewer verdict:** SHIP. Pass 0 completeness PASS (orphaned=0); Pass 1 functional PASS (tests 2377/2377, tsc 0 err, lint 0 err + 134 warn, build 479.82 KB ESM); Pass 1.5 alignment PASS (45 ALIGNED + 4 partial-to-scope + 3 scope-excluded + 0 divergent); Pass 2 security PASS (H41/H42/H43/H44/H45/H46 landed with tests; 0 credential-like strings in added lines); Pass 2.5 adversarial PASS-WITH-FOLLOW-UP (3 bounded Cycle 8 candidates: H40 runtime wiring, H48 TS field, H11 agent rollout); Pass 3 cross-wave PASS (W2B1 + Cycle 7 fixes all intact); Pass 4 domain-health PASS.

**Phase 5 (PRD update):** PENDING user approval. 4 phase_5_candidate findings (H55-H58, D17 strategic/marketing items) presented for CL-1 approval in `.audit-workspace/wave-2-batch-2/PHASE5-CL1-CANDIDATES.md`.

**Phase 6 (content specs):** SKIPPED — Cycle 7 Phase 6 specs still in flight (verify-wired.ts unimplemented); no new spec gap surfaced in W2B2.

**Phase 7 (audit evolution):** SKIPPED — Cycle 7 Phase 7 applied 10/10 proposals (commits c339a14...34f8962); no new evolution candidates in W2B2 sub-cycle.

## Closed-Loop Analysis

### Phase CL-1: PRD Evolution Candidates

| Candidate | Domain | Finding | PRD Section | Change Type | Priority |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Adopt feature-status taxonomy (implemented/wired/CLI-registered/tested) in §22 "Shipped" list | D18 + D16 | F18.1-H2, D16-SA16.1-4 | §22 | Replace | P0 |
| Replace §5 competitor table with pointer + D17 auto-refresh | D18 | F18.1-H1 | §5 | Replace | P1 |
| Rewrite §23 existential-risk row for shipped baseline (GitHub public, npm v1.5.1, OIDC) | D18 | F18.1-I3, F18.3-H2 | §23 | Rewrite | P1 |
| Prune §21 success metrics to "measured today" vs "deferred pending N users" | D18 | F18.1-M1 | §21 | Revise | P2 |
| Decouple Agent Teams from marketplace submission in §22 M2 | D18 | F18.2-H1 | §22 M2 | Restructure | P0 |
| Replace hard-coded content counts with derived-inventory pointer | D19, D10, D16 | F18.1-H3, F19.1.1/.2, D16-SA16.1-2 | §1, §22, §24 | Replace | P0 |
| Add "Wiring Before Declaration" architectural principle | D16 | D16-SA16.1-1 | New section | Add | P1 |
| Add "Silent Failure Contract" framework convention | D16 | D16-SA16.1-5 | New section | Add | P1 |
| Honestly partition trust-model controls: runtime-enforced vs delegated (SECURITY.md truth) | D15 | D15 Overarching | §20 or SECURITY.md | Revise | P1 |
| AAIF standard alignment positioning | D17 | 17.3-C | §5 or §22 | Add | P2 |

### Phase CL-2: Content Gap Artifacts

| Artifact | Type | Gap Description | Priority | Depends On |
|----------|------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| governance/audit/templates/severity-mapping.md | template | 5-column canonical map (reviewer verdicts, reviewer levels, security-auditor severity, check tags, audit severity); 3-cycle carry-over, 5 consumers blocked | **P1** | — |
| scripts/inventory.ts + governance/inventory.json | tool | Derive content/source counts from filesystem; feeds CLAUDE.md, README, plugin.json, D5/D9 domain files | **P1** | — |
| scripts/verify-wired.ts | CI check | Scans `src/cli/commands/` for every compliance-declared module; fails CI if module exists but not invoked | **P1** | D16-SA16.1-1 |
| 5 shared content extraction blocks → `agents/shared/` | content | Issue-type→skill mapping, tooling hierarchy, phase skip criteria, confidence expression, severity vocabulary currently duplicated across 4+ files each | **P2** | — |
| src/importers/cursor.ts (Cursor rules importer) | tool | D14 brownfield-adoption friction — 1-day effort for first competitor-format importer | **P2** | D14-SA14.4-001 |
| ESLint rule: flag catch-blocks without diagnostic emission | tool | Silent Failure Contract enforcement | **P2** | D16-SA16.1-5 |
| docs/wiring-invariant.md | docs | "Wiring Before Declaration" pattern documentation + examples | **P3** | — |

### Phase CL-3: Audit Self-Evolution Proposals (≤10)

| # | Proposal | Category | Current State | Proposed Change | Rationale | Risk |
|---|----------|----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Codify "read 18 tier synthesis files end-to-end" as D16 methodology | Process | D16 checklist says "synthesize across domains" (ambiguous) | Explicit mandate: read all 18 tier files; reject patterns with <3 domain citations | Cycle 7 D16 surfaced 4 additional Highs that Cycle 6 missed; deeper synthesis is load-bearing | Low — methodology addition, not scope change |
| 2 | Add D18 Phase 0 baseline: live-verify npm registry + GitHub API state | Process | Cycle 6 D18 used prior-cycle framing ("zero GitHub, zero npm") that was 7+ weeks stale | Mandate live verification before any distribution finding | Cycle 7 D18 found Cycle 6 framing materially stale — load-bearing for verdict | Low |
| 3 | Introduce feature-status taxonomy to finding-registry.json | Scoring methodology | finding-registry has execution_status but not implementation stage | Add 4-tuple: implemented / wired / CLI-registered / tested per finding | Would have caught D10-7.2.1/7.2.2, D8-SA8.4-1, D15 Overarching earlier | Medium — registry schema change |
| 4 | Severity discipline retrospective: D11 triaged 25 Medium → 6 Medium | Checklist refinements | D11 domain file has 4 sub-agents × broad checklists | Tighten D11 sub-agent scope; cap Medium findings at 8 per domain absent justification | Cycle 6 D11 over-indexed (Highs 4, Mediums 25); Cycle 7 triaged honestly | Low |
| 5 | Per-adapter currency research mandated, not optional | Checklist refinements | D9 file says "verify against latest docs" (P3 mandate) but Cycle 6 didn't enforce uniformly | Require URL + access date + trust tier citation for every adapter per cycle; staleness is a finding | Cycle 7 surfaced amazon-q + antigravity defects through rigorous currency check | Low |
| 6 | Cross-domain dedup: target 2-of-3 signal match | Process | Cycle 7 dedup gate rejected 12+ home-domain confirmations at D16 | Codify in AUDIT.md §Deduplication Protocol with examples | Current protocol allows inflation via home-domain redundancy | Low |
| 7 | Cycle 7 introduces 4th wave tier (beyond Cycle 6 3-wave) for systemic patterns | Process | AUDIT-EXECUTE.md has 4 waves but Wave 4 is loosely defined | Define Wave 4 as "cross-domain pattern" wave targeting D16 findings | 3 Cycle 7 D16 Highs cross 5+ domains; they deserve dedicated wave | Low |
| 8 | Allow domain orchestrators to bundle 2-3 related domains | Process | AUDIT.md spawns one sub-agent per sub-agent role (106 total) | Permit bundling D6-D8, D13-D14 as single domain-orchestrator invocations | Cycle 7 successfully bundled D6-D8 with quality-maintained output at lower orchestration cost | Low |
| 9 | Add "Inconclusive Areas" tracker in synthesis files | Process | Sub-agents may optionally add Inconclusive Areas (AUDIT.md line 251) | Upgrade to MUST for any domain with <3 Highs to flag depth concerns | Several Cycle 7 domains (D4, D12, D14) would benefit from explicit inconclusive tracking | Low |
| 10 | Pre-audit `verify --docs` validation gate | Process | Domain files can drift from code (D03 claims 47 test files, reality 88) | Run scripts/inventory.ts before audit start; auto-update or fail domain files | D3 domain file drift caught via Cycle 7 sub-agent observation | Medium — tool dependency |
