### Holistic Assessment

In 3-5 sentences, provide the orchestrator's subjective quality impression of the framework — independent of the formula score. What feels strong? What feels fragile? What is the overall craft quality and design coherence? Note specifically where the holistic impression diverges from the formula score and explain why. This section serves as a calibration signal for the scoring methodology.

## Enhanced Action Items

**This table MUST include every unique finding post-deduplication.** Do not curate, truncate, or limit to a "top N" subset. The execution prompt (`AUDIT-EXECUTE.md`) reads this table as the complete universe of findings.

Ordered by: Critical first, then High, Medium, Low. Within severity, order by impact-to-effort ratio (highest first).

Columns: `#`, `Domain`, `Action Item`, `Severity`, `Effort`, `Risk Score` (Impact x Likelihood x Reversibility, each 1-5), `Owner`, `Depends On`, `Status`.

**Status values:** `Open` (agent-actionable), `Open (human-only)`, `**Done**`, `Deferred (reason)`.

**Completeness check:** Total row count must equal the post-dedup finding count in the Executive Dashboard.

**Sections:** Blockers (Critical), Should-Have (High), Deferred (Medium/Low). Include: Estimated Total Effort, Recommended Sequence, Risk Assessment.

## Delta Since Previous Audit

(If previous audit exists) New findings, resolved findings, regressed findings, score changes per domain.
