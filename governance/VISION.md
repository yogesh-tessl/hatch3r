**Crack the egg. Hatch better agents.**

---

## What hatch3r Is

hatch3r is an open-source CLI and Cursor plugin that installs a battle-tested, tool-agnostic agentic coding setup into any repository. One canonical source in `/.agents/`, adapters generate native configuration for 15 AI coding platforms. Weekly-audited and continuously improved through a closed-loop system.

Run `npx hatch3r init`. Get a production-grade agentic setup. Start building.

Everything is plain text — reviewable, diffable, versionable. hatch3r generates configuration; it does not execute agents. The framework manages the how-to-instruct; the AI tools do the work.

---

## Who It's For

hatch3r is for everyone building software with AI coding assistants — solo developers to enterprise teams, any software type, any maturity level.

### Four Personas

**Individual Power User** — Wants a proven agentic setup without spending weeks hand-tuning prompts across tools. Picks up hatch3r, runs init, and immediately gets senior-engineer-quality results from their AI assistant.

**Team Lead / Platform Owner** — Needs consistent AI-assisted development practices across a team. Standardizes on hatch3r so every developer gets the same quality bar regardless of which AI tool they prefer.

**OSS Maintainer** — Wants contributors using AI tools to produce PRs that pass the project's code-review standards on first submission. Ships a `.agents/` directory so AI assistants understand the project's conventions, architecture, and quality expectations from day one.

**Legacy System Maintainer** — Needs AI assistance that respects existing patterns, understands old codebases, and makes incremental improvements without breaking things. hatch3r's outside-in perspective and non-destructive adoption model make this safe.

### Any Stack, Any Stage

Web apps, APIs, CLIs, mobile, infrastructure-as-code, monorepos, legacy systems. MVP prototypes to enterprise-grade production systems. The framework ships generic content that works everywhere; customization handles project-specific concerns.

---

## The Quality Bar

The north star metric is **one-shot success rate and post-implementation quality**.

The standard: senior engineer quality with an outside-in, user-facing perspective. Small-to-mid tasks should succeed on the first attempt. The result should be something a senior engineer would approve in code review — correct, well-structured, and considering edge cases.

Larger features (reusable components, styling consistency, i18n keys, complex wiring, edge cases across multiple files) are harder. This is a known gap, partly model limitations, partly content optimization opportunity. The framework continuously optimizes for these cases but acknowledges the boundary.

The revision loop — human tests as user, provides targeted feedback, agent fixes efficiently — works well. Optimize it, don't rethink it. Minimize the number of revision cycles needed, but make each cycle fast and effective when it happens.

---

## Up-to-Date Information

Agents must ALWAYS ground their work in current information. Web search, Context7 MCP, official documentation, project-specific context — never rely solely on training data.

This is not a feature of specific agents or skills. It is a general principle baked into how all content instructs agents. Every agent, every skill, every prompt assumes access to current information and instructs the AI to use it.

---

## The Closed Loop

hatch3r improves itself through a continuous closed-loop system.

### Weekly Cadence

```
Vision --> PRD --> Build --> Audit --> Execute Findings --> Update PRD --> repeat
```

The audit deploys all audit domains and all sub-agents for maximum depth. Findings are severity-tagged, scored, and prioritized. Execution follows a wave-based approach with regression gates between waves.

### Three Additional Loops

**Content Gap Identification** — Audit findings reveal missing agents, skills, rules, or commands. These become new content artifacts in the next cycle.

**Audit Self-Evolution** — The audit prompt itself improves over time. New domains, sharper sub-agents, better detection patterns. Changes require explicit user consent per proposal — the audit does not silently evolve.

**Learning System** — Project knowledge compounds over time. Each project gets smarter with each iteration. The framework captures learnings automatically and agents consult past learnings when working on similar problems.

### PRD as Living Document

The PRD evolves automatically from audit findings. Vision changes flow down through the PRD into content. The PRD handles the "how and when" — this document handles the "why and what."

---

## Content Maintenance Model

Content is ONLY maintained through the weekly audit cycle or in-between agentic work triggered by the framework owner. There is no separate maintenance process, no ad-hoc editing, no drift. Maximum end quality is the only metric that matters.

### Seven Content Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Agents** | Role definitions with expertise, constraints, and orchestration behavior |
| **Commands** | Slash-command workflows triggered by the user |
| **Prompts** | Reusable prompt templates for common patterns |
| **Rules** | Coding standards, conventions, and guardrails |
| **Skills** | Multi-step skill workflows (structured procedures) |
| **Hooks** | Event-triggered automation |
| **GitHub Agents** | CI/CD-integrated agent definitions |

Every content artifact must be auditable, versionable, and improvable through the audit cycle.

---

## Platform Strategy

All 15 adapters are equally supported. No first-class vs second-class platforms. If hatch3r supports a platform, that platform gets the full capability set that the platform's native format can express.

### Supported Platforms

Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, OpenCode, Windsurf, Amp, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cline/Roo Code, Aider, Kiro (rebranded from Amazon Q CLI), Goose, Zed, Amazon Q, AntiGravity.

### Parity and Adaptation

Platform changes — new features, API changes, deprecations — are detected and adapted within the weekly audit cycle. The adapter infrastructure maps canonical content to each platform's native format. Capability gaps between platforms are tracked and documented, not hidden.

---

## End-to-End Lifecycle Coverage

hatch3r covers the full software development lifecycle through its agents, skills, and commands — 11 phases from idea to maintenance.

| # | Phase | What It Covers |
|---|-------|---------------|
| 1 | **Vision Capture** | Re-envision — structured dialog to capture or refine project and framework vision |
| 2 | **Specification** | Project spec, codebase map — grounding agents in what exists |
| 3 | **Planning** | Roadmap, feature/bug/refactor/migration/test plans, API spec |
| 4 | **Board Management** | Board init, fill, groom, pickup, refresh — across GitHub, Azure DevOps, GitLab |
| 5 | **Implementation** | Implementer, workflow, quick-change, sub-agentic delegation |
| 6 | **Quality Assurance** | Reviewer, test writer, security/accessibility/performance auditors |
| 7 | **Revision** | Human tests as user, provides feedback, agent fixes efficiently |
| 8 | **Operations** | Release, healthcheck, dependency audit, cost tracking |
| 9 | **Knowledge Capture** | Automatic learning on the fly, onboarding |
| 10 | **Customization** | Per-agent/skill/rule/command overrides, recipes |
| 11 | **Framework Quality** | Weekly audit cycle keeps everything at peak |

## CLI Scope

The CLI handles framework management only:

- `init` — Install the agentic setup into a repository
- `sync` — Regenerate adapter output from canonical source
- `update` — Pull latest framework content
- `config` — Configure framework settings
- `status` — Show framework state
- `validate` — Check content integrity
- `verify` — Verify adapter output matches canonical source

The CLI is NOT a runtime. It generates configuration; it does not execute agents. Good standard developer experience — polished, fast, clear errors — but the CLI is not the primary differentiator. The content is.

---

## Learning System

Learning is automatic. The system captures learnings on the fly after each learning moment — not only when the user explicitly instructs it.

**Project-level only.** Users work on their projects, not on the framework itself. Learnings are scoped to the project and stored in the project's `.agents/learnings/` directory.

**Must not bloat.** Efficient storage, no redundancy, no noise. Old learnings that are superseded get consolidated or removed. The learning store stays lean and useful.

**Agents consult learnings.** When working on problems similar to past work, agents reference captured learnings. The project gets smarter with each iteration — patterns that worked, mistakes to avoid, project-specific conventions discovered through use.

---

## Principles

Stable and aspirational. These do not change week-to-week.

1. **Canonical source in `/.agents/`** — One truth, many outputs.

2. **Everything is plain text** — Reviewable, diffable, versionable. No binary blobs, no opaque databases.

3. **Generate, don't hand-edit tool configs** — Adapter output is derived. Edit the source, regenerate the output.

4. **Proven patterns over theoretical templates** — Content comes from what works in practice, not what sounds good in theory.

5. **Compound knowledge over time** — Every project interaction makes the next one better.

6. **Weekly audit cadence** — Continuous improvement is not aspirational; it is scheduled.

7. **Closed-loop evolution** — Audit findings flow into the PRD, the PRD drives content changes, content changes get audited. The loop never stops.

8. **Up-to-date information always** — Web search, Context7, official docs. Never rely on stale training data.

9. **One-shot success as the north star** — Every content change is measured against: does this make first-attempt success more likely?

10. **Equal adapter parity across all platforms** — No first-class or second-class citizens. Every supported platform gets the full capability set.

11. **Incremental adoption** — Legacy-friendly, non-destructive. Works with what exists, does not demand a rewrite.

12. **Sub-agentic by design** — Implementer delegation, structured workflows, parallel execution. Complex tasks decompose into focused sub-tasks.

13. **Quality through measurable standards** — Content quality is verified weekly against the shared quality charter (`agents/shared/quality-charter.md`). Agents think like senior engineers: question assumptions, consider multiple stakeholders, express uncertainty honestly, and ground every recommendation in current information.

14. **Behavioral charter governs agent conduct** — Agent behavioral standards are defined once and inherited everywhere. Audit sub-agents follow the audit behavioral charter (in AUDIT.md); end-user agents follow the shared quality charter. Both charters are living documents that evolve through the weekly audit cycle.

## Distribution

hatch3r is open-source. The focus is on building the ideal framework first. Distribution channels (npm, marketplace plugins, private registries) are secondary concerns that follow from getting the framework right.
