# Accessibility Audit Workflow

## Quick Start

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Read accessibility requirements from rules and specs
- [ ] Step 2: Automated scan — run axe-core or similar on all pages/components
- [ ] Step 3: Manual audit — load references/manual-audit-checklist.md
- [ ] Step 4: Catalog findings by severity (critical/major/minor)
- [ ] Step 5: Fix critical and major findings
- [ ] Step 6: Verify fixes with re-scan and manual check
```

## Progressive Disclosure

- **Main skill file (this):** Workflow steps, automated scan, fix process, DoD.
- **`references/manual-audit-checklist.md`:** Detailed WCAG requirements matrix, per-category manual criteria, severity cataloging rubric. Load during Step 3.

## Step 1: Read Accessibility Requirements

From project component rules (Accessibility section):

- All animations: wrap in `prefers-reduced-motion` media query AND check user's reduced motion setting.
- Color contrast: >= 4.5:1 for text (WCAG AA).
- Interactive elements: keyboard focusable with visible focus indicator.
- Dynamic content changes: use `aria-live` regions.
- Support high contrast mode.

For the full WCAG requirements matrix, load `references/manual-audit-checklist.md`.

For external library docs and current best practices, follow the project's tooling hierarchy.

## Step 2: Automated Scan

- Install and run `@axe-core/vue`, `vitest-axe`, or Playwright's `@axe-core/playwright` on all pages and key components.
- Run against: main routes, key components (if testable in isolation).
- Capture all violations. Map to WCAG criteria (e.g., 1.1.1, 1.4.3, 2.1.1, 4.1.2).
- Document: rule ID, description, impact, elements affected, WCAG level.

## Step 3: Manual Audit

Load `references/manual-audit-checklist.md` and work through each category:

1. Keyboard navigation
2. Color contrast
3. ARIA attributes
4. Reduced motion
5. Screen reader
6. High contrast mode

The reference file provides the specific criteria, DevTools settings, and pass/fail conditions for each.

## Step 4: Catalog Findings

Use the severity rubric in `references/manual-audit-checklist.md` to assign severity. Produce a findings table: ID, severity, WCAG criterion, description, location, fix suggestion. Prioritize critical first, then major. Minor can be batched.

## Step 5: Fix Critical and Major Findings

- Implement fixes following project component and quality requirements.
- Use semantic HTML where possible (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`).
- Add `aria-*` attributes for custom components.
- Verify `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected by enabling the media query in DevTools and confirming animations are disabled or simplified.
- Add or fix focus styles. Use design tokens for focus ring.
- Verify reduced-motion behavior in tests.

## Step 6: Verify Fixes

- Re-run automated scan. No critical or major violations.
- Manual keyboard and screen reader check on fixed areas.
- Run full test suite and confirm 0 failures to verify no regressions.
- Document remaining minor findings for future backlog.

## Required Agent Delegation

You MUST spawn these agents via the Task tool (`subagent_type: "generalPurpose"`) at the appropriate points:

- **`hatch3r-a11y-auditor`** — MUST spawn to perform the full WCAG AA compliance audit autonomously. Provide the list of surfaces/components to audit and the current violation list.

## Related Rules

- **Rule**: `hatch3r-browser-verification` — follow this rule for live browser-based accessibility testing

## Error Handling

- **No automated scanner available**: If axe-core, Lighthouse, or equivalent is not installed, report the gap and proceed with manual checklist-only audit. Do not skip the audit.
- **Scanner produces false positives**: Cross-reference automated findings against manual inspection. Mark confirmed false positives with justification and exclude from the violation count.
- **Component renders differently across browsers**: Test in at least two browser engines (Chromium + Firefox or Safari). Document browser-specific a11y gaps with reproduction steps.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] No critical a11y violations
- [ ] WCAG AA compliance on all audited surfaces
- [ ] Reduced motion respected (`prefers-reduced-motion` + user setting)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation complete with visible focus
- [ ] Color contrast >= 4.5:1 for text
- [ ] ARIA live regions for dynamic content
- [ ] Automated scan clean for critical/major
- [ ] Manual verification completed
