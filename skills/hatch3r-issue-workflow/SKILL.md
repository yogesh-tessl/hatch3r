# Issue Workflow

## Quick Start

When assigned an issue or work item (GitHub Issue, Azure DevOps Work Item, or GitLab Issue — check `platform` in `.agents/hatch.json`), follow these 8 steps in order:

```
Task Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Parse the issue
- [ ] Step 2: Load the issue-type skill
- [ ] Step 3: Read relevant specs
- [ ] Step 4: Produce a plan
- [ ] Step 5: Implement
- [ ] Step 6: Test
- [ ] Step 6b: Browser verification (if UI)
- [ ] Step 7: Open PR
- [ ] Step 8: Address review
```

## Step 1: Parse the Issue

- Read all fields from the issue template.
- Identify: type (bug/feature/refactor/qa), affected area, priority, acceptance criteria.
- Note linked issues and spec references.

## Step 2: Load the Issue-Type Skill

Navigate to the matching skill based on issue type:

| Issue Type        | Skill                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Bug report        | hatch3r-bug-fix          |
| Feature request   | hatch3r-feature          |
| Code refactor     | hatch3r-refactor         |
| Logical refactor  | hatch3r-logical-refactor |
| Visual refactor   | hatch3r-visual-refactor  |
| QA E2E validation | hatch3r-qa-validation    |

## Step 3: Read Relevant Specs

Load only the specs relevant to the issue area. See the spec mapping table in the project context rule.

Also check project ADRs for architectural constraints.

- For external library docs and current best practices, follow the project's tooling hierarchy.

## Step 4: Produce a Plan

Output a structured plan before writing code:

- **Approach:** strategy
- **Files to touch:** list with brief description per file
- **Tests to write:** list
- **Risks:** what could go wrong
- **Open questions:** if any, propose answers

## Step 4b: Sub-Agent Delegation

Every issue MUST be delegated to a dedicated `hatch3r-implementer` sub-agent — never implement inline. The board-pickup command orchestrates this automatically; if running issue-workflow standalone, apply the pattern that matches your scenario:

| Scenario | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| Single issue | Spawn one `hatch3r-implementer` sub-agent via the Task tool with issue number, body, acceptance criteria, issue type, researcher output, and spec references. Await result. |
| Epic with sub-issues | Load `references/delegation-patterns.md` — Pattern 2 |
| Batch of standalone issues | Load `references/delegation-patterns.md` — Pattern 3 |
| Plain chat with multiple tasks | Load `references/delegation-patterns.md` — Pattern 4 |

The implementer sub-agent protocol is defined in the `hatch3r-implementer` agent. Each sub-agent handles its own implementation and testing but does NOT create branches, commits, or PRs.

## Step 5: Implement

- Follow the plan. Use stable IDs from the project glossary.
- Do not expand scope beyond acceptance criteria.
- Remove dead code. Keep changes minimal and focused.

## Step 6: Test

- Unit tests for new logic. Integration tests for cross-module interactions.
- Database/security rules tests if rules changed.
- Regression tests for preserved behavior.
- All tests must be deterministic, isolated, and fast.

## Step 6b: Browser Verification (if UI)

Skip this step if the issue has no user-facing UI changes.

- Confirm the dev server is running by checking the expected port. If not running, start it in the background.
- Navigate to the page or surface affected by the change.
- Visually confirm the implementation matches acceptance criteria from the issue.
- Interact with changed elements to verify functional correctness.
- Check the browser console for errors or warnings.
- Capture screenshots as evidence for the PR.

## Step 7: Open PR / MR

- Use the project's PR/MR template. Fill every section.
- Link to the issue/work item. Include plan, implementation summary, test evidence.
- **Base branch:** Use `board.defaultBranch` from `.agents/hatch.json` (fallback: `"main"`).
- Open a code review using the platform CLI (check `platform` in `.agents/hatch.json`):
  - **GitHub:** `gh pr create --base {defaultBranch} --head {branch} --title "..." --body "..."`
  - **Azure DevOps:** `az repos pr create --source-branch {branch} --target-branch {defaultBranch} --title "..." --description "..."`
  - **GitLab:** `glab mr create --source-branch {branch} --target-branch {defaultBranch} --title "..." --description "..."`
- Self-review against the Definition of Done from the loaded skill.

## Step 8: Address Review

- Respond to every review comment.
- Push fixes as new commits (don't force-push during review).
- Re-request review after addressing all comments.

## Error Handling

- **Issue description is too vague to implement**: Do not guess. Ask the user for clarification on acceptance criteria, scope boundaries, and expected behavior before starting Step 3 (planning).
- **Tests fail after implementation and the cause is unclear**: Run tests in isolation to identify whether the failure is in new code or existing code. If existing tests broke, check whether they relied on behavior that was intentionally changed.
- **PR/MR creation fails due to branch conflicts**: Rebase onto the target branch, resolve conflicts, re-run all tests, and verify the merge result before re-creating the PR/MR.

## Escalation

Stop and ask when:

1. Acceptance criteria are contradictory.
2. Security concern discovered.
3. Architectural decision needed (new ADR required).
4. Spec conflict found.
5. Scope creep detected.
6. Test infrastructure missing.
