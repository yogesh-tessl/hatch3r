# Component Conventions

## Structure

- Use framework-recommended component syntax (e.g., `<script setup>` for Vue).
- Define props with typed interfaces.
- Define emits/events with typed interfaces.
- Use composables/hooks from project composables directory — never mixins.
- Use stores or equivalent for shared state.

## Naming

- Component files: PascalCase (e.g., `PetWidget.vue`, `QuestPanel.vue`).
- Component names match file names.
- Props: camelCase. Events: kebab-case.

## Styling

- Use the project's design tokens for colors, spacing, typography.
- Prefer utility classes or scoped CSS with BEM naming.
- No inline styles except for dynamic values that can't be expressed as classes.
- No hardcoded color values — use tokens.

## Accessibility (Required)

- All animations: wrap in `prefers-reduced-motion` media query AND check user's `reducedMotion` setting.
- Color contrast: ≥ 4.5:1 for text (WCAG AA).
- Interactive elements: keyboard focusable with visible focus indicator.
- Dynamic content changes: use `aria-live` regions.
- Support high contrast mode.

## State Patterns (Required)

### Loading States
- Use skeleton screens (not spinners) for content areas — match the layout shape of the loaded content.
- Apply a shimmer/pulse CSS animation on skeletons to indicate activity.
- Load content progressively: show available data immediately, fill remaining sections as they resolve.
- Buttons that trigger async actions must show an inline loading indicator (spinner + disabled state) and prevent double-click.

### Error States
- Wrap route-level components in an error boundary that catches render failures and displays a fallback UI.
- Show inline error messages directly below the failed content area with a retry action button.
- Use toast/notification for non-blocking errors (network hiccups, background sync failures) — auto-dismiss after 5–8 seconds with a manual dismiss option.
- Failed components must never render a blank space — always show a fallback with a brief explanation and recovery action.

### Empty States
- Display an illustration or icon with a concise, helpful message explaining why the area is empty.
- Include a primary action CTA that guides the user toward populating the area (e.g., "Create your first project").
- Provide contextual guidance or links to documentation when relevant.
- Differentiate "no data yet" (first-time experience) from "no results found" (active filter/search with a clear-filters action).

### Transition States
- Apply optimistic updates for mutations: reflect the expected outcome immediately, roll back on failure with an error toast.
- Show a pending/saving indicator for in-flight mutations (e.g., subtle progress bar or "Saving..." text).
- Use stale-while-revalidate patterns: display cached data immediately, update in the background, and indicate when a refresh is available.

## Form UX (Required)

### Validation Timing
- Validate on blur for the user's initial input into a field.
- After the first validation error, switch to validate on change so the user sees corrections in real time.
- Always run full form validation on submit as a fallback.

### Error Display
- Show inline error messages directly below the field, linked via `aria-errormessage` and `aria-invalid="true"`.
- Provide an error summary at the top of the form (linked to individual fields) for screen reader users.
- Use a clear visual error indicator: red border + error icon + descriptive text — never rely on color alone.

### Field Patterns
- Group related fields with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` (e.g., "Shipping Address", "Payment Details").
- Use progressive disclosure for complex forms: show advanced options behind an expandable section or a follow-up step.
- Autofocus the first input field on form mount.
- Verify tab order follows the visual layout order by tabbing through the form — never use positive `tabindex` values.

### Submit Behavior
- Disable the submit button when the form has known validation errors (but keep it focusable for screen readers).
- Show a loading indicator on the submit button during submission.
- Provide clear success feedback: redirect to the result page or display a success toast.
- Prevent double submission by disabling the button and ignoring duplicate submit events during pending requests.

### Accessible Labels
- Every `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` must have a visible `<label>` element with a matching `for`/`id` pair.
- Mark required fields with a visual asterisk (`*`) and screen-reader-only text ("required").
- Associate help text or format hints with the field via `aria-describedby`.

## Performance

- UI must render at 60fps (≤ 16ms per frame).
- Prefer CSS animations/transitions over JavaScript animations.
- Use conditional visibility (e.g., `v-show`) over conditional mount (e.g., `v-if`) for frequently toggled elements.
- Lazy-load panels that aren't immediately visible.

## Testing

- Snapshot tests for all visual states.
- Component tests for interactive behavior.
- Verify reduced-motion behavior in tests.
